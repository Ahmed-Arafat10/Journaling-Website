                <h3>Best: Power Scaling</h3>
                <p>For once, Hunter x Hunter introduced a power scaling that isn’t complete mambo jumbo. Let’s reiterate
                    that, Hunter x Hunter’s power scaling is possibly one of the most consistent to ever be featured in
                    the shonen genre.

                    The series puts a high emphasis on its world’s logic. Nothing can ever, not even the power of
                    friendship, break the logic that has been deeply rooted in Hunter x Hunter. If Gon doesn’t train for
                    at least a decade, there’s no way he’ll be able to defeat a character like Meruem.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feat">
                <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-down fa-3x"></i>
                <h3>Fell Short: Not Long Enough</h3>
                <p>A series’ longevity is vital to its overall performance. A long-lived series can leave a lasting
                    impression on fans regardless of its actual quality. Hunter x Hunter is by no means short but in
                    comparison to the big three, it comes out as lacking.

                    However, as the series is still ‘ongoing’ that’s still too early to judge. Once the series is over –
                    if it’s ever over – then we’ll come to the final conclusion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feat">
                <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-down fa-3x"></i>
                <h3>Best: Animation</h3>
                <p>Animation is the backbone of any anime; if the animation is bad, then regardless of plot, characters,
                    and world, the experience is bad. Contrarily, if the animation was good, then no matter how subpar
                    the other aspects were, one could have a relatively fun experience.

                    With that said, Hunter x Hunter’s animation is phenomenal, to say the least. The quality never
                    regresses, instead, it progresses alongside the plot.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feat">
                <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-down fa-3x"></i>
                <h3>Fell Short: A Bit Dark</h3>
                <p>There’s nothing wrong with a series being dark – if said series was not of the shonen genre that is.
                    Shonen is known for its wide demographics, people of all ages tune into shonen anime. Moreso, the
                    shonen genre often tackles positive subjects such as friendships...etc

                    Hunter x Hunter, however, does not abide by these cliches. The show tackles rather dark topics – at
                    least by the shonen standards – like nuclear warfare. In retrospect, this might negatively affect
                    the perception of those who only tune into shonen for the positive energy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feat">
                <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-down fa-3x"></i>
                <h3>Best: Cast</h3>
                <p>Hunter X Hunter's roster of characters is as huge and diverse as a shonen cast could get. Each and
                    every character is vivid and unique on their right. Nobody, regardless of how minor their role is,
                    feels two-dimensional or half-assed.

                    Characters like Killua and Kurapika are explored in great detail, while the anime often takes an
                    ensemble approach to its storytelling in some of the bigger arcs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feat">
                <i class="far fa-arrow-alt-circle-down fa-3x"></i>
                <h3>Best: Power System</h3>
                <p>By this point, it should be pretty obvious that Hunter x Hunter is not an average shonen. Power
                    systems govern the fighting laws of shonen battle series, albeit they are often overlooked.</p>

                                The journey begins with Gon taking a series of bizarre tests to become a Hunter, which
                                includes navigating a deadly jungle, hunting other applicants, killing a wild boar, an
                                extraordinarily long underground marathon, and making sushi. During the Hunter Exam, Gon
                                meets and befriends three of the applicants, Kurapika, Killua, and Leorio. The series'
                                first antagonist is also introduced as one of the applicants. Hisoka is a complex
                                villain who uses playing cards as weapons and views Gon as an "unripe fruit" that he
                                will take great pleasure in killing once he's grown up enough to present a challenge.
                                Before the end of the Hunter Exam, Killua faces his brother, Illumi, who makes him come
                                home before he can even finish the exam.

                        <h3>Ging Freecess Vs Muherr's Henchmen </h3>
                        <p>A true testament to Ging's skills in Nen was given when he was attacked by Muherr's henchmen.
                            On that occasion, he copied Leorio's remote punch perfectly and at the first attempt. He
                            later explained that he generally can mimic other people's striking abilities as long as he
                            has been hit with it, but further elaborated it as merely a natural talent and not a Nen
                            ability.</p>

                        When Pariston casts doubt on Ging's suspicions against him, Ging quickly ascertains that
                        Pariston has no interest in negotiating with the Association but is rather playing with it for
                        his own personal reasons. Ging remarks on the strangeness of Pariston's actions, asking him,
                        "Why are you trying so hard to destroy it if you're obsessed with it? Quite a twisted form of
                        love." Ging admits to Pariston that they are similar in the fact that they both think in
                        unorthodox ways, then concludes by calling Pariston a bastard.

                    <p>
                        Pariston says, "Wow, you really know how to lay into someone. That was harsh. But you were
                        totally spot on, so no hard feelings..." Pariston confides in Ging that he is unlike most people
                        who feel happy when they are loved and love in return. Instead, Pariston feels happiest when he
                        is hated by others, and feels the urge to destroy the things he loves most. When Pariston turns
                        the question on Ging, asking whether this mentality is really so strange, Ging coldly replies
                        that it is and that in this respect, he and Pariston are nothing alike.
